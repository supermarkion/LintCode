/*
    Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. if there is no cycle, return null.

    Link: http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/linked-list-cycle-ii/

    Example: Given -21->10->4->5, tail connects to node index 1ï¼Œreturn 10

    Solution: The main part is that we should make sure that it exists a cycle in the linked list. Then, if we can find next
    node, we make quick pointer move twice, or return null to get there is no cycle in the linked list.
