/*
    Write a program to find the nth super ugly number. Super ugly numbers are positive numbers whose all 
    prime factors are in the given prime list primes of size k. For example, [1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 13, 14, 16, 
    19, 26, 28, 32] is the sequence of the first 12 super ugly numbers given primes = [2, 7, 13, 19] of 
    size 4.
