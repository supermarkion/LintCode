/*
    Given 3*n + 1 numbers, every numbers occurs triple times except one, find it.

    Link: http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/single-number-ii/

    Example: Given [1,1,2,3,3,3,2,2,4,1] return 4

    Solution: Given an array of integers, every element appears k times except for one. Find that single one which appears
    l times. We need a array x[i] with size k for saving the bits appears i times. For every input number a,
    generate the new counter by x[j] = (x[j âˆ’ 1]&a)|(x[j]& a). Except x[0] = (x[k]&a)|(x[0]& a).
